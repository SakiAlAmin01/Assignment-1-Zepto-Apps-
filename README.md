# Assignment-1-Zepto-Apps-
This repository contains the solution for Assignment 1, where the goal was to create a full-width and full-height box that covers the entire viewport. The text “Zepto Apps” is perfectly centered both vertically and horizontally within this box using only raw HTML and CSS (no frameworks or libraries).
